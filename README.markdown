# Auto Expire

Auto Expire adds the ability to any weblog to automatically expire new entries. It adds a predefined amount of time to the entry date. If an expiraion date has already been set, that date will be used as the expiration date.

## Info

Developed by Wouter Vervloet, http://www.baseworks.nl/

This version of Auto Expire is developed for ExpressionEngine 1.6.x

## Usage

After installing Auto Expire it's settings are available at Weblog Administration › Weblog Management › Edit Weblog Preferences > Weblog Posting Preferences. I know it's a bit hidden, but it seemed the most logical place to put them to me.

The textfield is the number of minutes|hours|days|weeks|months|years to add to the entry date.
