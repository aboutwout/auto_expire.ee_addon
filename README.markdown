# Auto Expire

Auto Expire adds the ability to any weblog to automatically expire new entries. It adds a predefined amount of time to the entry date. If an expiration date has already been set, that date will be used as the expiration date. 

As of version 1.3 the ability to change the status on expiration is available.
